# MedChain üè•

**Healthcare Device Lifecycle Management Protocol on Blockchain**

MedChain is a comprehensive blockchain-based platform for tracking medical device lifecycles and managing regulatory compliance. Built on the Stacks blockchain, it provides transparent, immutable records of device manufacturing, testing, deployment, and certification processes.

## üöÄ Features

- **Complete Lifecycle Tracking**: Monitor devices from manufacturing to maintenance
- **Regulatory Compliance Management**: Handle FDA, CE Mark, ISO 13485, and safety certifications
- **Immutable Audit Trails**: Blockchain-based history of all device status changes
- **Multi-Authority Support**: Multiple regulatory bodies can issue certifications
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for manufacturers and regulators

## üìã How It Works

### For Device Manufacturers
1. **Register Device**: Create a new device record with initial manufacturing status
2. **Update Lifecycle**: Track device through testing, deployment, and maintenance phases
3. **Request Certifications**: Work with regulatory bodies to obtain required certifications
4. **Monitor Compliance**: View all certifications and audit trails in real-time

### For Regulatory Bodies
1. **Get Authorized**: Protocol admin authorizes regulatory bodies for specific certification types
2. **Issue Certifications**: Grant FDA, CE Mark, ISO, or safety certifications to compliant devices
3. **Monitor Devices**: Track device status and compliance across the ecosystem
4. **Revoke Certifications**: Remove certifications for non-compliant devices

### For Healthcare Providers
1. **Verify Compliance**: Check device certifications before procurement
2. **Track History**: Access complete audit trail of device lifecycle
3. **Ensure Safety**: Validate regulatory approvals for patient safety
